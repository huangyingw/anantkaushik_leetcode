Given an integer n. Each number from 1 to n is grouped according to the sum of its digits. 
Return how many groups have the largest size.

Example 1:
Input: n = 13
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 9 groups in total, they are grouped according sum of its digits of 
numbers from 1 to 13:
[1,10], [2,11], [3,12], [4,13], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]. There are 4 groups with largest size.

Example 2:
Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are 2 groups [1], [2] of size 1.

Example 3:
Input: n = 15
Output: 6

Example 4:
Input: n = 24
Output: 5
 
Constraints:
1 <= n <= 10^4
